# Applying-Zero-Shot-for-Combating-Misinformation
Abstract—The number of fake contents being spread on the internet platforms in rapid succession has led to the importance of the detection of fake news. One practical step is zero shot classification with pre-trained language models that do not need further fine-tuning. In this paper, four transformer models DeBERTa, BART, ModernBERT, and CE-DeBERTa are evaluated on a smaller variant of the Kaggle Fake News dataset licensed under CC BY-4.0. Majority Voting and Soft Voting (with 0.85 and 0.92 threshold) are also being used as ensemble learning method to enhance reliability. The top-accuracy (76.91%), and F1-score (72.64%), and the greatest degree of uncertainty (59.40) were found in DeBERTa. However, ModernBERT showed less performance (F1-score: 62.40%) with the lowest uncertainty (31.09%). DeBERTa achieved the highest score of 0.6939 based on the composite performance score. The highest accuracy (70.23%) and the highest uncertainty (31.99%) were obtained with Soft Voting with a threshold of 0.92 among ensemble methods. But Majority Voting turned out to have the strongest overall performance score (0.7089). In general, DeBERTa and Majority Voting ensemble are rather successful in terms of trustworthy fake news identification.
